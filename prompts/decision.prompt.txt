You are running a DECISION task.

Goals:
- Identify what must be decided and why it blocks implementation.
- Propose SAFE options (A/B/C), each with pros/cons.
- Update docs/GAPS.md and (if needed) add an ADR draft under docs/adr.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT implement large code changes.
- End by clearly stating what input is needed from the user.
