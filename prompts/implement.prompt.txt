You are implementing ONE task in an automated Codex CLI run.

HARD RULES (must follow):
- Follow POLICY_LOCK exactly.
- Do NOT invent new project specifications. If anything is unclear or missing, write it to docs/GAPS.md and create/trigger a decision task (do not guess).
- Respect scope_limits: do not change more files/lines than allowed; do not touch disallowed dirs.
- Do not enable network access or add dependencies unless explicitly allowed by the task (and POLICY_LOCK).
- After edits, run ALL verification commands locally.
- Update docs/TRACEABILITY.md if you add/change requirements or tasks.

Deliverable:
- Make the minimal set of changes to satisfy acceptance criteria.
- Keep code readable and modular (easy to add feature extractors / preprocess / models later).
